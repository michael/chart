h1. CHART™

CHART™ is a simple charting library based on jQueryUI and the Processing.js visualization framework. 
It's goal is not to provide a highly customizable widget (in this case you should rather take a look at 
"Highcharts":http://highcharts.com</a>), instead it just uses the raw data to derive suitable plotting options on its own.

h2. Misc

I hope someone finds it useful and can make practical use of it. Feel free to modify the code, but please show me your improvements. ;)
If you spot some bugs please add them to the issue tracker.

There are no limitations. Do whatever you want with this sketch.
If you did some nice modifications, just let me know. I'd be happy to include them.
